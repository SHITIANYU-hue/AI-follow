  <summary><b><a href="https://www.bakerlab.org/2023/07/11/diffusion-model-for-protein-design/">RFdiffusion: A generative model for protein design</a></b></summary>

  - *Affiliation*： University of Washington
  - *Keywords*： Diffusion models, Protein design 
  - *Summary*：The paper presents a novel deep learning framework, called RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion), for protein design. By fine-tuning the RoseTTAFold structure prediction network on protein structure denoising tasks, the authors achieve remarkable performance in designing various types of proteins, including binders, symmetric architectures, enzyme active site scaffolds, and therapeutic and metal-binding proteins. RFdiffusion enables the generation of complex and functional proteins from simple molecular specifications, demonstrating its potential for advancing protein design using deep learning techniques.
